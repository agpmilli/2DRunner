# Let's draw!

Let's draw is a webapp where you can draw. While you are drawing others can also draw.
Basically you can draw with other people, all on the same canvas.

I made this to make myself familiar with websockets. I also learned a lot about node.

You can find a version of this website on http://drawing.tristantrouwen.com/.

This project is inspired by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRqwX-V7Uu6b36TzJidYfIYwTFEq3K5qH">video series off Daniel Shiffman</a>.
